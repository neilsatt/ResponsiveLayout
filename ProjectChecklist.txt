8 TOTAL STEPS


1) Organize your Sass files 
- Create a scss folder - DONE
- Create subfolders - DONE
- Each subfolder should have _index file and at least one SCSS partial
- Create at least one partial
- Make sure you have a folder for your compiled CSS


2) Create your Partial files
-  Group related sections of CSS into SCSS partials



3) Create an application.scss file in the root of your project
- Import all of your _index.scss partials into it
- Make sure your imports are listed in the correct order for styling



4) Find repeating patterns in the stylesheet and extract them into placeholder selectors, 
then extend them wherever necessary.
- Create at least one placeholder selector
- Extend three CSS selectors with your placeholder using the @extend keyword


5) Create variables for repeating values
- At minimum, create variables for:
	All color values
	All media query breakpoints
- Make sure you use your color variable in your project to replace 
- ALL instances of that color property values

6) Nest your media queries in their respective rules and use your breakpoints variables 
to define ALL the breakpoint widths


7) Create at least one mixin for a common text pattern. As a minimum, include the following 
arguments in your mixin:

- font-size
- font-weight
- color
- Add your mixin as a declaration using @include in at least three rules where any 
   of the text properties listed above are present


8) Create at least one example of a nested Sass rule that is not a media query. Remember to make 
sure that nested rules are not greater than 3 levels deep, excluding when a nested mixin is present.

A nested Sass example:
nav {
   ul {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        list-style: none;
    }
  li { 
        display: inline-block;
  }
  a {
       display: block;
       padding: 6px 12px;
       text-decoration: none;
   }
}



You don’t need to make any changes to your original design, but be sure to compile your CSS and make sure 
the site is still responsive and works well on different screen sizes before you submit for grading.
